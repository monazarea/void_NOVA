Void Nova is an interactive e-learning mobile application developed using Flutter and Unity to engage users in learning about space through both educational content and immersive augmented reality (AR) gaming. The app offers users a unique experience by providing two main features:
1- Learning Section: Users can explore educational content related to space, including stories about exoplanets, quizzes, and a gallery of celestial images.

2- AR Game Section: Through Unity's AR integration, users can interact with an AR-based space exploration game, where they experience space travel and defend planets based on their types (terrestrial, gas giants, etc.).

Key technologies include Flutter for the mobile app interface and state management, and Unity for the AR game, seamlessly connected within the app. The app provides an engaging, hands-on learning experience for users, enhancing their knowledge of space while interacting with the virtual environment.
